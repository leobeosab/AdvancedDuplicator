# Unity Advanced Duplicator

Easy to use duplicator for any type of game object within Unity, allows for adding offsets using formulas such as (w - n * 3) which would just be the width of the object - the current duplicate number * 3

## TODO
1. [ ] This needs a hella big refactor after adding in duplication shapes
2. [ ] Make the Linear function actually Linear and not just by offset
3. [ ] Add Width, Length, Height vars to offset calculation
4. [ ] Some more things I'm forgetting
5. [ ] Add Gifs of working extension

Feel free to contribute!
